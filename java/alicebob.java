// Alice and Bob recently got into running, and decided to compare how much they ran on different days.
//         They each ran for N days â€” on the ith day, Alice ran Ai meters and Bob ran Bi meters.       On each day,
//         Alice is unhappy if Bob ran strictly more than twice her distance, and happy otherwise.
//         Similarly, Bob is unhappy if Alice ran strictly more than twice his distance, and happy otherwise.
//         For example:
//         If Alice ran 200 meters and Bob ran 500, Alice would be unhappy but Bob would be happy.
//         If Alice ran 500 meters and Bob ran 240, Alice would be happy and Bob would be unhappy.
//         If Alice ran 300 meters and Bob ran 500, both Alice and Bob would be happy.
//         On how many of the N days were both Alice and Bob happy?
